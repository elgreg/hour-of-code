## Tools

* c9.io
* Chrome inspector

## Basics

* What's a server? What's a client?
* html tags have open and close tags that work like bookends
* Find these on the page and guess what they mean? `<h1>`..`<h6>`, `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<ol>`/`<ul>`?
* css for styling:
  * `color`, `background`
  * `font-size`, `font-family`?
* Not sure how much more we'll have time for
