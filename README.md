## Introduction / Overview

* How many of you have ever been to a website?
* What's a server? What's a client? How do they communicate? That's _code_.

## Tools

* c9.io
* Chrome inspector
 * View page source
 * Inspect
  * Hover over elements to highlight
  * Styles pane
  * Select an element to inspect it
 * Any tabs besides Elements worth getting into?

## Basics

* html tags have open and close tags that work like bookends
* Find these on the page and guess what they mean? `<h1>`..`<h6>`, `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<ol>`/`<ul>`?
* css for styling:
  * `color`, `background`
  * `font-size`, `font-family`?
* Not sure how much more we'll have time for
